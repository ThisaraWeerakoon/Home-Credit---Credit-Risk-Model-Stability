You can have a look into our  paper <a href= "https://drive.google.com/file/d/12xjQ5EoS9Szn4rrqDtnvbSFjNoXqeRMI/view?usp=sharing">Credit Risk Prediction with CatBoost and LGBM</a> (not published just for having an exposure for writing a research paper) for a comprehensive explanation about our approach

Inspired by the kaggle competition  <a href= "https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-credit-risk-model-stability">Home Credit - Credit Risk Model Stability</a>
 
## Description   
The objective of this project is to develop a model that predicts the likelihood of clients defaulting on their loans, with a strong emphasis on maintaining feature stability over time. This competition aims to provide consumer finance providers with a more reliable and enduring method to evaluate a potential client's risk of default.

- **Motivation:** The goal is to create a stable and reliable model for predicting loan defaults, focusing on individuals with little or no credit history.
- **Why:** Many potential borrowers are unfairly denied loans due to a lack of traditional credit history, limiting their financial opportunities.
- **Problem Solved:** We aim to develop a model that maintains performance stability over time, reducing the need for frequent updates and ensuring consistent loan risk assessment.
- **What We Learned:**
  - **1:** Data preprocessing specially this project gave the experience of preparing our train dataset by combining different files in different formats which was really challenging.
  - **2:** the importance of balancing model performance and stability both
